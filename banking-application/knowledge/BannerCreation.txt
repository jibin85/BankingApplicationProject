To create a Banner:

Banner is the ASCII art which is to be displayed in the console once the application Starts

To begin with,

1. If no banner is there Spring will give the default banner.
2. To Customise the banner create a .txt file containing the ASCII art generated from any website under 
   src/main/resources in that particular module.
3. To refer that banner go to application.properties in the same src/main/resources and give the below comment to enable
   the banner to be displayed.
   -- "spring.banner.location=classpath:banking-reference-data-banner.txt"
4. Build the project and run the application.
5. The updated ASCII art will be reflected in the application console.
